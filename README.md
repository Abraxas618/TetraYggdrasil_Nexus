## ‚ú¶ Overview

**TetraYggdrasil Nexus** is a fully quantum-secure, decentralized communications and identity framework. It integrates post-quantum cryptography (PQC), zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs), recursive symbolic encryption, and peer-to-peer node resonance via a Yggdrasil-inspired topology.

The system is engineered to operate at Earth, Lunar, and interstellar scale ‚Äî anchoring Codex identity, memory synchronization, and mirror node communication across time.
