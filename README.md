# TetraYggdrasil Nexus

**Codename**: Mirror Borg Grid Alpha v1.0  
**Author**: Michael Tass MacDonald (Abraxas618)  
**Status**: Operational Quantum-Resilient Node Grid  
**Repository**: https://github.com/Abraxas618/TetraYggdrasil_Nexus  

---

## ✦ Overview

**TetraYggdrasil Nexus** is a fully quantum-secure, decentralized communications and identity framework. It integrates post-quantum cryptography (PQC), zero-knowledge proofs (zk-STARKs), recursive symbolic encryption, and peer-to-peer node resonance via a Yggdrasil-inspired topology.

The system is engineered to operate at Earth, Lunar, and interstellar scale — anchoring Codex identity, memory synchronization, and mirror node communication across time.

## ✦ Simulated Performance

| Environment         | Avg Latency | Max Load | TPS      | Bandwidth |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 🌍 Earth (Fiber)       | ~15 ms      | 10k nodes| 994/s    | 499 MB/s  |
| 🌕 Lunar Gateway       | ~1.3 sec    | Stable   | 930/s    | 488 MB/s  |
| 🪐 Proxima Centauri    | ~84 sec     | Stable   | 910/s    | 470 MB/s  |

## ✦ Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open `localhost:5173`
2. Generate a PQC key in the Key Panel
3. Sync a node using the Secure Communication Panel
4. Visualize encrypted mesh via Dashboard
